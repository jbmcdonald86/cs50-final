SETUP

1. Open up CS50 IDE, in a workspace with Harvard's CS50 template and change into the /final directory with ~/workspace/ $ cd final

2. Once you are in the directory, install all the required packages with ~/workspace/final $ sudo pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

3. If for some reason, you cannot use Harvard's CS50 workspace template, you will need to change to Python version 3 with ~/workspace/final $ sudo mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2 and then ~/workspace/final $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

4. In a new terminal window, change to the same directory /final and export the flask application variable with ~/workspace/final $ export FLASK_APP=application.py

5. Start the flask application in that same terminal window with ~/workspace/final $ flask run

6. Copy and paste into a new web browser tab the url that flask gives you shortly after you enter the flask run command, which should be on the same line as "* Running on [url] (Press CTRL+C to quit)".
